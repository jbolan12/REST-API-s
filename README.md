# REST-API-s

API Authentication Project.- A Node.js application that interacts with the Secrets API for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting secret data. This project includes routes to perform these operations using different HTTP methods. This app uses the Express framework and Axios to communicate with the Secrets API. It allows users to interact with the API by retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting secret data entries. The project demonstrates the use of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for API interactions.
